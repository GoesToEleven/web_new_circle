        <p> Facebook had its application for the iPhone ready right when the Apple App Store opened in July 2008. But
            more
            than a year after the iPad went on sale, there is still no official Facebook app for it.</p>

        <p>That is about to change. People briefed on Facebookâ€™s plans say that in coming weeks the company plans to
            introduce a free iPad application that has been carefully designed and optimized for the tablet.</p>

        <p>The app has been in production at Facebook for almost a year, going through several design iterations, and is
            now in the final stages of testing, according to these people, who declined to be named because they were
            discussing confidential product plans.</p>
