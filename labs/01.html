        Facebook had its application for the iPhone ready right when the Apple App Store opened in July 2008. But more
        than a year after the iPad went on sale, there is still no official Facebook app for it.

        That is about to change. People briefed on Facebook’s plans say that in coming weeks the company plans to
        introduce a free iPad application that has been carefully designed and optimized for the tablet.

        The app has been in production at Facebook for almost a year, going through several design iterations, and is
        now in the final stages of testing, according to these people, who declined to be named because they were
        discussing confidential product plans.

        THE NEW YORK TIMES | Netscape's browser debuted 20 years ago. Only a few months after it came out, the company
        seemed to be the runaway leader in a field with growth rates not seen since the early, heady days of the
        personal computer business. - Ashwin Seshagiri
