    Facebook had its application for the iPhone ready right when the Apple App Store opened in July 2008. But more
    than a year after the iPad went on sale, there is still no official Facebook app for it.

    That is about to change. People briefed on Facebook’s plans say that in coming weeks the company plans to
    introduce a free iPad application that has been carefully designed and optimized for the tablet.

    The app has been in production at Facebook for almost a year, going through several design iterations, and is
    now in the final stages of testing, according to these people, who declined to be named because they were
    discussing confidential product plans.
